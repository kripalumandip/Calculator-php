PHP Calculator Project
Overview
This project is a simple calculator created using PHP and HTML. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on user inputs.

Features
Accepts two numbers and an arithmetic operation from the user.
Performs the following operations:
Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Multiplication (*)
Division (/)
Validates user input to ensure that only numbers are processed.
Handles division by zero by providing an appropriate error message.
How It Works
Users enter two numbers and select an arithmetic operation through the provided form.
Upon submission, the PHP script processes the input data.
The script checks for valid numbers and executes the chosen calculation.
The result of the calculation is displayed on the same page.
Technologies Used
PHP: Used for server-side logic and calculations.
HTML: Used to create the user input form.
How to Run the Project
Ensure you have a local web server installed (e.g., XAMPP or MAMP).
Save the project files in the server's root directory (e.g., htdocs for XAMPP).
Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost/your-project-folder.
Fill in the form with numbers and the operation, then click "Submit" to see the result.
Future Enhancements
Implement CSS for improved styling and user interface.
Add advanced mathematical operations like exponentiation or modulus.
Include client-side validation using JavaScript to enhance user experience.
