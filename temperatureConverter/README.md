Temperature Converter Project
Overview
This project is a simple temperature converter created using PHP and HTML. It allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

Features
Accepts a temperature value from the user.
Provides options to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit or from Fahrenheit to Celsius.
Validates user input to ensure that only numeric values are processed.
How It Works
Users enter a temperature value and select the conversion type (Celsius to Fahrenheit or Fahrenheit to Celsius) using the provided form.
Upon submission, the PHP script processes the input data.
The script checks if the input is numeric and performs the selected conversion.
The result of the conversion is displayed on the same page.
Technologies Used
PHP: Used for server-side logic and calculations.
HTML: Used to create the user input form.
How to Run the Project
Ensure you have a local web server installed (e.g., XAMPP or MAMP).
Save the project files in the server's root directory (e.g., htdocs for XAMPP).
Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost/your-project-folder.
Fill in the form with a temperature value and select the conversion type, then click "Submit" to see the result.
Future Enhancements
Implement CSS for improved styling and user interface.
Add additional conversion options (e.g., Kelvin).
Include client-side validation using JavaScript to enhance user experience.
